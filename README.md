# Lee Wang Jong
I'm a 4th-year student at Tokyo International University.

I have recently started learning web-development and programming.

I have a goal to become a front-end developer. It has only been a little over a month, but I am loving the journey.

## Work Experience:

### HENNGE (2020)
I work under the director of the Presidents Office Divison at an IT company in Shibuya, Tokyo called HENNGE.
While learning about software development and cloud security (HENNGE's service), I assist the director with his tasks in organizing his 
daily duties and schedules.

### Startup Guide (2019-2020)
I was the Project-Product manager for Startup Guide - Tokyo book and the most recent Startup Guide - Japan Regional book (Freelance)
These books are created for entrepreneurs (or soon-to-be) to inform them of the current startup eco-system in each specific area; everything to cost-of-living to law, 
it is a guide book for all keen entrepreneuers and even for venture capitalist looking to find new eco-systems to invest in.
My tasks were: Execution, monitor and control, and delivery. 

### BARK (Former SLUSH TOKYO) (2019-2020)
In between my freelance time as the project manager for Startup Guide, I was also part of the event-organization SLUSH TOKYO which we rebranded into BARK.
As the leader of "People Operations", my tasks were presenting our organization and our mission to students and entrepreneurship-aspirers. 
I held many events over several universities across greater Tokyo to showcase our organization and to meet students who were inspired to build their own product or service.
