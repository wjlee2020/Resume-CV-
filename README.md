# Lee Wang Jong
I'm a 4th-year student at Tokyo International University.
I keep myself highly motivated; it's a great pleasure to be able to learn and apply everything that I learned into personal projects.
Although I am new to the programming world, I challenge myself to constantly learn and apply my knowledge to grow as an aspiring front end developer.

## Work Experience:

### Tangerine Inc. (2021)
Working with senior developers on a legacy product/service. My tasks are to help create new features based on UI designs given by clients. For example, a new setting's page that: 1) grabs previously set user-settings and 2) able to add/edit to a new, preferred setting.

Although it is a challenge as it is my first time working with such a large code base as well as AngularJS, it is a great opportunity for me to learn: how to navigate around, work with a team, and learn bits and pieces of a new framework.

I also help as a field support intern, assisting the team in the setting up the beacons as well as wifi RSSI tests.

### Startup Guide (2019-2020)
I was the Project-Product manager for Startup Guide - Tokyo book and the most recent Startup Guide - Japan Regional book (Freelance)
These books are created for entrepreneurs (or soon-to-be) to inform them of the current startup eco-system in each specific area; everything to cost-of-living to law, 
it is a guide book for all keen entrepreneuers and even for venture capitalist looking to find new eco-systems to invest in.
My tasks were: Execution, monitor and control, and delivery. 

### BARK (Former SLUSH TOKYO) (2019-2020)
In between my freelance time as the project manager for Startup Guide, I was also part of the event-organization SLUSH TOKYO which we rebranded into BARK.
As the leader of "People Operations", my tasks were presenting our organization and our mission to students and entrepreneurship-aspirers. 
I held many events over several universities across greater Tokyo to showcase our organization and to meet students who were inspired to build their own product or service.
